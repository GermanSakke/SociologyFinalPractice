# Sociology Final Practice — Demo

This repository contains a React component `SociologyPracticeTest` (TypeScript JSX) that renders a 50-question practice test UI.

What I added
- `sociology_practice_test.tsx` — original component (kept at root for now)
- A minimal Vite + React + TypeScript demo scaffold so you can run the component locally.

Run the demo
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/sociology-practice-test-repo
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes
- This is a minimal demo wrapper around the provided component. If you want, I can adapt the component into a full app layout, add tests, or configure CI.
